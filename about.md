### To whom it may concern

I'm Hoang, graduate student at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Getafe Campus. Madrid is the sleepless city and the weather is really great, sun shines for 340/365 days. Well, that's only bad when we have exams or a qualification. People talk, drink beer and football shouting at every conners. Such a nice place for making friends and "enjoy life" especially in the summer.

Before obtaining Master degree, I attended Vietnam National Economics University with a major in finance and had a chance to be a teaching assistant after that. My research interest changed several times before I fall in love with Bayesian inference. It would be nice experience here, in the Statistics department!

I am also fond of playing with a new program and syntax so I create this site to get to know Markdown first and second to take a place at [#Github](http://github.com/hoanguc3m). Although I came a little bit late but I'll try to catch up with this trend. 


### More Information

I have moved in Madrid for more than there years pero mi español esta malo. Espero mejorar día a día.
