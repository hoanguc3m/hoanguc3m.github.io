### To whom it may concern

I'm Hoang, graduate student at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Getafe Campus. Madrid is the sleepless city and the weather is really great, sun shines for 340/365 days. Well, that's only bad when we have exams or a qualification. People talk, drink beer and football shouting at every conners. Such a nice place for making friends and "enjoy life" especially in the summer.

Before obtaining Master degree, I attended Vietnam National Economics University with a major in finance and had a chance to be a teaching assistant after that. My research interest changed several times before I fall in love with Bayesian inference. It would be nice experience here, in the Statistics department!
