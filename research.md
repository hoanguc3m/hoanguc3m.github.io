According to my knowledge, we are the first who aim to find out the dynamic relationship between genuine savings (GS) and long term well-being represented by future consumptions (PVC). By extending the measure of GS to account for wider range of impacts on natural resource, human capital and technological progress, we  apply Bayesian approach to estimate Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs). We discover that there are increasing dependent trends with all explanatory GS variables and provide a new empirical evidence on the technological progress that underpin Swedish sustainable development.  The dynamic model also provides a trivial framework for testing the hypothesis that their relationship approach to one as the net investment term includes more types of capital.

Abstract: Exogenous information such as policy news and economic indicators  can have the potential to trigger significant movements in financial asset volatility. This article presents a model, called the RECH-X model,  that allows incorporating exogenous variables into a recurrent neural network for volatility modeling and forecasting. The RECH-X model can allow for abrupt changes in the volatility level and effectively capture the complex serial dependence structure in the volatility dynamics. We demonstrate in a wide range of applications that the RECH-X model consistently outperforms the benchmark models in terms of volatility modeling and forecasting.

Abstract: This study explores the benefits of incorporating fat-tailed innovations, asymmetric volatility response, and an extended information set into crude oil return modeling and forecasting. To this end, we utilize standard volatility models such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH), Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and Stochastic Volatility (SV), along with Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regressions, which enable us to incorporate the impacts of relevant financial/macroeconomic news into asset price movements. For inference and prediction, we employ an innovative Bayesian estimation approach called the density-tempered sequential Monte Carlo method. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of exogenous variables is beneficial for GARCH-type models while offering only a marginal improvement for GAS and SV-type models. Notably, GAS-family models exhibit superior performance in terms of in-sample fit, out-of-sample forecast accuracy, as well as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall prediction.

Abstract: In the paper we consider the optimal portfolio choice problem under parameter uncertainty when the covariance matrix of asset returns is singular. Very useful stochastic representations are deduced for the characteristics of the expected utility optimal portfolio. Using these stochastic representations, we derive the moments of higher order of the estimated expected return and the estimated variance of the expected utility optimal portfolio. Another line of applications leads to their asymptotic distributions obtained in the high-dimensional setting. Via a simulation study, it is shown that the derived high-dimensional asymptotic distributions provide good approximations of the exact ones even for moderate sample sizes.

Abstract: There is evidence that macroeconomic variables influence the relationship among financial variables, however they are sampled at different frequencies. This study proposes a generalized autoregressive score mixed frequency data sampling (GAS MIDAS) copula approach to analyze the dynamic relationship between Stock returns and Bond returns. A GAS MIDAS copula decomposes their dependence into a short-run and a long-run correlation. While the long term effect is updated at a lower frequency using MIDAS, the short term effect follows a GAS process. Asymmetric dependence at different quantiles are taken into account. The model helps to improve the in-sample goodness of fit and the out-of-sample forecast.

Abstract: Stock and oil relationship is usually time-varying and depends on the current economic conditions. 
In this study, we propose a new Dynamic Stochastic Mixed data frequency sampling (DSM) copula model,  that decomposes the stock-oil relationship into a short-run dynamic stochastic component and a long-run component,  governed by related macro-finance variables. 
We find that inflation/interest rate, uncertainty and liquidity factors are the main drivers of the long-run co-dependence. 
We show that investment portfolios, based on the proposed DSM copula model, are more accurate and produce better economic outcomes as compared to other alternatives.

Abstract: With the uncertain changes of the economic environment, macroeconomic downturns during recessions and crises can hardly be explained by a Gaussian structural shock. There is evidence that the distribution of macroeconomic variables is fat-tailed and asymmetric. 
In this paper, we contribute to the literature by extending the VAR models to account for a more realistic assumption of the multivariate distribution of the macroeconomic variables. We propose a general class of Generalized Hyperbolic Skew Student's-t distribution with stochastic volatility (Skew-t.SV) VAR that allows us to take into account fat tails and asymmetry. The Bayesian inference using a Gibbs sampler is extended to make inferences of model parameters. 
We present evidence of fat tails and asymmetry for monthly macroeconomic variables. The analysis also gives a clear message that asymmetry should be taken into account to have a better prediction during recession and crisis. .

Abstract: In this paper we analyze how skewness and heavy tails affect the estimated relationship between the real economy and the corporate bond-yield spread, a popular predictor of real activity. We use quarterly US data to estimate Bayesian VAR models with stochastic volatility and various distributional assumptions regarding the disturbances. In-sample, we find that – after controlling for stochastic volatility – innovations in GDP growth can be well-described by a Gaussian distribution. In contrast, both the unemployment rate and the yield spread appear to benefit from being modelled using non-Gaussian innovations.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyse Okun’s law – a relation between the change in the unemployment rate and GDP growth – using data from Australia, the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States. More specifically, we assess the relevance of non-Gaussianity when mod-elling the relation. This is done in a Bayesian VAR framework with stochastic volatility where we allow the different models’ error distributions to have heavier-than-Gaussian tails and skewness. Our results indicate that accounting for heavy tails yields improvements over a Gaussian specification in some cases, whereas skewness appears less fruitful. In terms of dynamic effects, a shock to GDP growth has robustly negative effects on the change in the unemployment rate in all four economies.

<!---
In this paper, we analysed the heavy-tailed behaviour in the dynamics of housing-price returns in the United States. We investigated the sources of heavy tails by estimating autoregressive models in which innovations can be subject to GARCH effects and/or non-Gaussianity. Using monthly data from January 1954 to September 2019, the properties of the models were assessed both within- and out-of-sample. We found strong evidence in favour of modelling both GARCH effects and non-Gaussianity. Accounting for these properties improves within-sample performance as well as point and density forecasts.

Abstract: Stock returns are considered as a convolution of two random processes that are the return innovation and the volatility innovation. The correlation of these two processes tends to be nega-
tive which is the so-called leverage effect. In this study, we propose a dynamic leverage stochastic volatility (DLSV) model where the correlation structure between the return innovation and the
volatility innovation is assumed to follow a generalized autoregressive score (GAS) process. We find that the leverage effect is reinforced in the market downturn period and weakened in the
market upturn period.

<!---
In this paper, we study the relation between the high-yield bond spread and the unemployment rate in the euro area. This is done using Bayesian VAR models with stochastic volatility. The models are estimated assuming both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions for the error terms. Analysing data ranging from January 1998 to December 2020, our results show that an increase in the high-yield bond spread increases the unemployment rate. In terms of the specification of the models, we find that Gaussian error terms are preferred. Our findings hence lend support for the large body of previous literature relying on a Gaussianity assumption in their modelling frameworks.

<!---
In this paper we assess whether flexible modelling of innovations impact the predictive performance of the dividend price ratio for returns and dividend growth. Using Bayesian vector autoregressions we allow for stochastic volatility, heavy tails and skewness in the innovations. Our results suggest that point forecasts are barely affected by these features, suggesting that workhorse models on predictability are sufficient. For density forecasts, however, we find that stochastic volatility substantially improves the forecasting performance.

<!---
In this paper, we make two contributions to the literature of factor copula models. First, we employ a Variational Bayesian algorithm to make fast inference for multi-factor and structured factor copulas. Compared to the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, the VI approximation is much faster and could handle a sizeable problem in a few seconds with high accuracy. Second, we derive an automated procedure to recover the dependence structure. By taking advantage of the posterior sample means, we inspect the initial assumption of bivariate copula functions and switch for a better one by minimizing Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The simulation in different context shows that the procedures of bivariate copula selection could be at least 80% accuracy compared to the true generated copula model.

We propose a class of dynamic factor copulas for financial data where the dynamic correlation are modelled as generalized autoregressive score (GAS) processes. The model could account for the asymmetric dependence in extreme events. We implement an parallel algorithm to estimate the different pamameters of the factor copula models. An empirical example is illustrated for the stock price of 140 companies listed in S&P500.
