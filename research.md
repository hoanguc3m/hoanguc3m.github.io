* *Parallel Bayesian inference for high dimensional dynamic factor copulas*, joint with [M. Concepcíon Ausín](http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/dpto_estadistica/personal/Concepcion_Ausin) and [Pedro Galeano](http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/dpto_estadistica/home/members/pedro_galeano_san_miguel) (UC3M)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We propose a class of dynamic factor copulas for financial data where the dynamic correlation are modelled as generalized autoregressive score (GAS) processes. The model could account for the asymmetric dependence in extreme events. 
We implement an parallel algorithm to estimate the different pamameters of the factor copula models.
An empirical example is illustrated for the stock price of 150 companies listed in S&P500.

* *What are the drivers of the Swedish sustainable development path? New evidence from Bayesian Dynamic Linear Models*, joint with Jesper Stage, Magnus Lindmark, Huong Nguyen Thu

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  According to my knowledge, we are the first who aim to find out the dynamic relationship between genuine savings (GS) and long term well-being represented by future consumptions (PVC). By extending the measure of GS to account for wider range of impacts on natural resource, human capital and technological progress, we  apply Bayesian approach to estimate Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs). We discover that there are increasing dependent trends with all explanatory GS variables and provide a new empirical evidence on the technological progress that underpin Swedish sustainable development.  The dynamic model also provides a trivial framework for testing the hypothesis that their relationship approach to one as the net investment term includes more types of capital.
